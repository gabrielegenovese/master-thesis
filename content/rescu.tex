\chapter{ReSCu}\label{sec:rescu}
I now present \textsc{ReSCu} (first introduced in \cite{desgeorges2023rsc, di2023multiparty, guizouarn2023communicating}),
describing its features, the input
language it uses, its implementation, and the modifications I introduced to
extend its functionality~\cite{rescuoriginalrepo}. The updated repository with 
the new examples is available on GitHub~\cite{rescurepo}.

\section{Characteristics}
\textsc{ReSCu} is a command-line tool that can check both membership in the 
class of \verb|synch| systems (called Realizable with Synchronous Communication 
or, in brief, RSC from now on) and reachability of regular sets of configurations. It 
accepts input systems with arbitrary topologies and supports both FIFO and 
bag buffers. The tool provides several options: 
\verb|-isrsc| checks whether the system is RSC, and \verb|-mc| checks reachability of 
bad configurations. Both checks can be combined in a single run. The \verb|-fifo| option 
overrides buffer types by treating all as FIFO. When a system is unsafe, the 
\verb|-counter| option (used with \verb|-mc|) produces an RSC execution that leads 
to the bad configuration, while the same option used with \verb|-isrsc| outputs the 
borderline violation execution if the system is not RSC. Additional features include 
a progress display to estimate remaining runtime during long computations, and 
\verb|-to_dot|, which exports the system to DOT format for visualization.
One of the most similar tools is \textsc{McScm} \cite{heussner2012mcscm}, that
uses a framework with for different verification techniques. 
Symbolic Communicating Machines (SCM), defined and used in \cite{brand1983communicating} 
serve as the input format of the tool.
A formal definition for this object is stated in Definition~\ref{def:cfsm}.
The grammar has been updated to provide greater flexibility and clarity. In
particular, transition guards have been made optional (with a default value
\verb|: when true|), and a new \verb|final| keyword has been introduced to
explicitly specify final states. The updated grammar is shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:scm-grammar}.

\section{Progress and Deadlock-Freedom}
I extended \textsc{ReSCu} with verification routines that focus on two
fundamental correctness properties of distributed systems: \emph{progress} and
\emph{deadlock-freedom}. To enable this, the tool constructs the synchronous
system using the synchronous product whenever the input SCM is recognized as an
RSC. These two verification routines are triggered only after another check: 
once the system is proven to be RSC, we can safely construct a well-formed 
synchronous product from it. We consider the definitions given in Chapter~\ref{sec:pre}.
Definition~\ref{def:cfsm} corresponds to the concept of an SCM. We now present the
definition of the Synchronous Product for CFSMs, which has been implemented in the
tool and serves as a key component for analysing.

\bigskip

\begin{definition}[Synchronous Product]
Let $\mathcal{S} = (\mathcal{A}_p)_{p \in \mathbb{P}}$ be a system of CFSMs, where 
$\mathcal{A}_p = (L_p, \mathit{Act}_p, \delta_p, l_{0,p}, F_p)$ is the CFSM associated 
to process $p$.  

The \emph{synchronous product} of $\mathcal{S}$ is the global type 
$\mathrm{prod}(\mathcal{S}) = (L, \mathit{Arr}, \delta, l_0, F)$,
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $L = \prod_{p \in \mathbb{P}} L_p$ is the set of global locations,
    \item $l_0 = (l_{0,p})_{p \in \mathbb{P}}$ is the initial global state,
    \item $F = \prod_{p \in \mathbb{P}} F_p$ is the set of global final states,
    \item $\delta$ is the transition relation defined as follows:  
    $(\vec{l}, \; p \xrightarrow{m} q, \; \vec{l}\,') \in \delta$ if
    \[
    (l_p,\, !m^{p \to q},\, l'_p) \in \delta_p, \quad 
    (l_q,\, ?m^{p \to q},\, l'_q) \in \delta_q, \quad 
    l'_r = l_r \;\; \text{for all } r \notin \{p,q\}.
    \]
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

After constructing the synchronous product, the tool performs several
important post-processing operations. In particular, it removes any
unreachable nodes from the resulting product, simplifying the structure
and ensuring that only relevant states are retained for further analysis.
We can now define the two properties added to the tool.

I denote \verb|Reach| as the function that, given a node, gives the set of 
reachable nodes, and $\text{Init}, \text{Final}$ as the initial and final node.
Informally, a given system satisfies \emph{progress} if, 
from every reachable node,
either the system can eventually perform a transition, or the node is
a final one.

\bigskip

\begin{definition}[Progress]
	A system $S$ has the progress property iff $\text{Prod}_{sync}(S)$
	has the property
	$\text{Reach}(\text{Init})\subseteq \text{Reach}(\text{Final})$.
\end{definition}

%% sostituire posit con reach: sono tutti gli stati raggiungibili

In other words, this property is implemented by checking the existence of 
any not-final-node without outgoing transitions.
This definition allows infinite loops.
Informally, a system is \emph{deadlock-free} if no reachable
non-final node exists in which all processes are blocked (i.e., no further
actions can be taken).

% For a set of executions $\mathcal{E}$, we write Prefixes($\mathcal{E}$) 
% for the set of all prefixes of the executions in $\mathcal{E}$.

\bigskip

\begin{definition}[Deadlock-Freedom]
	A system $S$ is deadlock-free iff
    $\text{Prod}_{\text{sync}}(S)$ has the property
	$\text{Reach}(\text{Init})\subseteq \text{Prefixes}(\text{Final})$.
\end{definition}
%% mettere controesempio x questa def: in un sistema non sincrono potrei non vedere un deadlock con questa def

%% nella tesi mettere la def di ppdp spiegata bene che è quella che include tutte le semantiche di network

% Intuitively, the set of all the execution that starts from the initial state
% are a section of the set of all prefixes of the executions that start from
% the final state.
More precisely, a system that can reach, from its initial states, some state
that does not lead to a final state is not deadlock-free. Under this definition,
even a loop that never reaches a final state is considered a deadlock,
making the property more restrictive. This check is implemented using a
reverse search algorithm starting from the final states.

% TODO: Specificare che questa nozione di deadlock-freedom vale per il paper di cinzia

Additionally, the synchronized system can be exported in DOT format
(with a default filename of \verb|sync.dot|), which allows for graphical 
visualization of its structure and behaviour.
% Some illustrative examples 
% demonstrating these new features are included in the
% \verb|rescu/examples/deadlock| folder.
Let's finally see some relevant examples.

% TODO: CINZIA, X TESI:
% pensare ad un esempio che fa vedere che non è vero in generale

% TODO: migliorare visualizzazione dei grafi
\section{Examples}

To illustrate these notions, I present two examples. The first is the
classical \emph{Dining Philosophers} problem, which shows how resource
contention can lead to deadlock. The second is a minimal looping system
that demonstrates how a process may satisfy the progress property while
still failing to be deadlock-free.

\bigskip

\begin{example}\label{exm:philo}
Consider two philosophers $P_0, P_1$ and two forks $F_1, F_2$, arranged
so that each philosopher needs both forks to eat. If both philosophers
pick up their left fork simultaneously, each waits indefinitely for the
other fork, producing a deadlock. This captures the essence of the Dining
Philosophers problem: concurrent processes blocking one another when
competing for shared resources.

\begin{lstlisting}[language={},caption={Output of Example~\ref{exm:philo}},
    label={lst:philo}]
This system is RSC.
There are some sink states:
Sink: Id=11 Configuration={{ F0:4; F1:3; P1:2; P2:2 }}
There are some deadlock states:
Deadlock: Id=4 Configuration={{ F0:2; F1:1; P1:1; P2:1 }}
Deadlock: Id=11 Configuration={{ F0:4; F1:3; P1:2; P2:2 }}
Deadlock: Id=8 Configuration={{ F0:4; F1:1; P1:1; P2:2 }}
Deadlock: Id=7 Configuration={{ F0:2; F1:3; P1:2; P2:1 }}
\end{lstlisting}

The behaviour of the four participants is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:philo}. Running the tool on
this input produces the terminal output in
Listing~\ref{lst:philo} and the corresponding synchronous system in
Figure~\ref{fig:philo-sync}. In the
generated figure, the red state marks a configuration where no further
actions are possible, while the three yellow states correspond to
deadlocks, i.e.\ executions where both philosophers wait for each other
indefinitely. The terminal output also lists the precise configurations
of these problematic states.

\begin{example}\label{exm:loop}
Now consider two processes $A$ and $B$ that exchange data. At some
point, each makes a nondeterministic choice: one branch continues
sending messages indefinitely, while the other leads to termination.
Once the choice to continue is taken, however, there is no way to
return to the terminating branch. As a result, the system may remain
stuck in an infinite loop, never reaching a final state. Although both
processes remain active, the system is effectively deadlocked.

\begin{lstlisting}[language={},caption={Output of Example~\ref{exm:loop}.},
    label={lst:loop}]
This system is RSC.
The system has the progress property.
There are some deadlock states:
Deadlock: Id=17 Configuration={{ A:1; B:4 }}
Deadlock: Id=15 Configuration={{ A:3; B:3 }}
\end{lstlisting}

The behaviour of this system is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:loop}. 
Executing the tool produces the output in
Listing~\ref{lst:loop} and the synchronous system in
Figure~\ref{fig:loop-sync}. In the
generated figure, yellow states highlight the deadlocked executions,
while the terminal output provides the configuration of each detected
deadlock.
