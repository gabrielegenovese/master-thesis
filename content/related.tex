\paragraph{Realizability for MSCs}

For finite sets of MSCs, weakly realizability is \verb|coNP|-complete and safe 
realizability is shown to be decidable in \verb|P|-time~\cite{alur2005realizability}.
The problem was subsequently studied for infinite MSC languages, defined 
as MSC-Graphs (MSGs). For bounded MSGs, safe realizability 
remains decidable, but weak realizability 
is undecidable~\cite{alur2005realizability}. Extensions of these results to non-FIFO 
semantics were investigated in~\cite{morin2002recognizable}, corresponding 
to bag semantics under peer-to-peer communication. 
Later, Lohrey proved that in the general case, safe realizability 
is undecidable~\cite{lohrey2003realizability}, though it is decidable (and 
EXPSPACE-complete) for MSGs. %for globally cooperative MSGs.
Most positive results assume bounded channels, but \cite{bollig2025high} introduces 
a new class of HMSCs that allows unbounded channels while maintaining implementability.
A summary of the main complexity results is given in Table~\ref{tab:realizability}.

\paragraph{Realizability for MPST}

Recent work has focused on strengthening the connection between MPST 
and automata-theoretic formalisms. Stutz and Zufferey 
showed that implementability is decidable by encoding global types 
into HMSCs that are globally cooperative~\cite{stutz2022comparing,stutz2023asynchronous}. 
Building on this, Li et al.~\cite{li2023complete} proposed a complete 
projection function for MPST, guaranteeing that every implementable 
global type admits a correct distributed implementation.

Stutzâ€™s thesis~\cite{stutz2024implementability} connects MPST to 
High-level MSCs (HMSCs), introducing a generalized projection operator 
for sender-driven choice where a sender may branch towards different 
receivers. This captures patterns beyond classical MPST projection.  
He also proves that while syntactic projection is incomplete, 
an automata-theoretic encoding into HMSCs yields decidability for 
sender-driven choice, with implementability shown to be in 
\verb|PSPACE|-the first precise complexity bound for this fragment.


\paragraph{Protocol State Machines}
Stutz et al.~\cite{stutz2025automata} proposed \emph{Protocol State Machines} 
(PSMs), an automata-based formalism subsuming both MPST and HMSCs. 
PSMs show that many syntactic restrictions of global types are not 
true expressivity limits. Yet, the implementability problem for PSMs 
with unrestricted mixed choice remains undecidable, resolving the 
open question that mixed-choice global types are undecidable in general.  

In summary, projectability is well understood for sender-driven choice, 
where decidability and complexity bounds are established, but moving 
towards mixed choice inevitably leads to undecidability. Automata-based 
techniques such as HMSCs and PSMs provide the most powerful tools for 
extending the theory while preserving decidability in restricted cases.
